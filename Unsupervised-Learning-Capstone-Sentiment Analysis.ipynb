My dad was dating. I’m his Purple Heart. My dad would say borderline-racist shit to me when I was a kid. Borderline-racist shit. But I knew he was joking. It’s my dad. Just sitting at the dinner table, like, “You know why I married your mom, right?” I’m, like, “Why?” “Because I love Chinese food.” “She’s Filipino, Dad.” “Whatever.

My mom raised us like we were still in the Philippines. She tried to cure everything at home, like a real Filipino woman. You had to… You had to die to go to the hospital. Shit. My mom cured everything with Vicks VapoRub. Vicks VapoRub! I should’ve died nine times when I was a kid. That’s abuse! There was one time I thought I had pneumonia. I go, “Mom, I think I have pneumonia.” She goes, “I’ll put extra Vicks on your body, Joseph. Just rub it everywhere, Joseph. Rub it on the bottom of the foot, and then put a sock on the foot, and then the pneumonia will come out of the foot, Joseph.” I’m just smothered in fucking Vicks. I should’ve called the cops.',\n",

I can’t sleep, Mom.” My mom took her finger and stuck it in Vicks and rubbed it on top of my eyelids. On top of my eyelids! That shit burned so bad. I go, “Mom, it burns!

Get out of the Foot Locker!” “I’m not even in the Foot Locker!”',\n",

       " 'Shit on my dreams. I’m telling you this: I became a comedian, which is totally against the grain when you have a Filipino mom. If you have a Filipino mom, that is not the career choice you’re supposed to have. Filipino moms predetermine what their kids are supposed to be when they grow up. And you know I’m not making this shit up. There’s a lot of Filipinos in here, right now, that are nurses. Today is a good day to get injured at a show… because there will be a nurse in here, like… [in Filipino accent] “Oh, my God. Put a cold compress on the head. Elebate the peet! Elebate… Elebate the peet.” “What the fuck is ‘elebate’?” “Just lipt! Lipt the pucking peet! Are you stupid?”',\n",

My mom wanted me to be a nurse. Are you fucking kidding me? Filipino moms shit on their kids’ dreams. And you know I’m not lying. You know I’m not lying. You can’t have a dream. “What are you talking about… dream?” I told my mom I wanted to be a comedian. She cried. “Why? Why do you want to be a comedian, Joseph? All your aunties are nurses, your cousins are nurses. Do you see any clowns in this family? I don’t. Do you?” Shit on my dream right there. Just looked at me and went like this: “Joseph, who told you you were funny? It wasn’t me.”',\n",
       " 'That’s fucked up. I’m just saying… you’re a nurse, God bless you. But you know there are some nurses out there that didn’t follow their dreams. There are some nurses working at the hospital that wish they were a Jabbawockee. You know exactly what I’m talking about. “Hey, follow me to the X-ray.” “I’ll follow you…” “Goddamn, that nurse can dance.” “It was always my dream. My mother did not believe in me.” Oh, fuck.',\n",
       " 'It’s either nurse or mailman. Mailman’s another strong option. Oh, shit. My mom cried and even suggested, “Joseph, be a mailman. Your uncles are mailmen. Your cousins, they’re mailmen.” My stepdad, he’s white. He’s a fucking mailman! I swear to God. I asked him, “Fred, why’d you become a mailman?” He’s, like, “Your mama told me to become a mailman. She shit on my dreams.”',\n",

Come home from school, and here’s my uncle. By the way, my uncle is one of those Filipinos that hide their accent. He’s got a thick accent, but he likes to hide the accent because he doesn’t want anyone to think that he has an accent. And it just ends up sounding like a worse accent. He sounds like a Filipino Elvis. And I came home, I came through the door. He got up, he’s, like… [deep voice, thick accent] “Joseph, let me talk to you for a second. So, I hear you want to be a comedian?” Like, what the fuck did you just say?',\n",

Identical fucking twins. Just… They’re just cut from the same cloth. I don’t know what it is about Filipino women. They’re beautiful at the age of 20, but right when they hit 69, they all morph into the same Filipino woman. Short hair, glasses. Louis Vuitton purse. “Where are we? Seattle? Moore Theatre?” [chuckling]',\n",
       " 'Break that mold, man. I told my son. I told him. I’m breaking that mold.

Thanks, Dad.” I go, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” He goes, “I want to be an architect.” And I go, “Joe… I’ve seen you draw. You got another dream? What the fuck are you talking about?

And that’s when I stopped taking care of him. Because that’s what you’re supposed to do when you’re a parent. Twelve? “You should know how to brush your teeth now. You know what to do, Joe.” But now that I ignore the fact that he doesn’t brush his teeth, I have to fucking deal with the breath. The breath, it comes in hot. Hot. And he’s breathy when he talks. [breathy voice] “Dad. Dad. Dad.” I’m, like, “Joe, what did I tell you to do when you talk to me?” “Face the wall.” “Face the wall and write it down. Let me read what the fuck you’re trying to say to me.” Armpits. God damn it. Armpits smell like chopped onions. And I always get mad. I’m, like, “Joe, why do I smell it first? I’m over here. You’re right fucking here.” I grab the deodorant every time. “Joe, this is all you gotta do. Just rub it under this armpit like that. That’s all you gotta do. Now, listen to me. Here’s the important part. When you go to the other armpit, I want you to go across your mouth.”',\n",
       " 'Just dirty. My son is dirty. He loves it. He thinks it’s the funniest thing. Still doesn’t know how to sneeze correctly. Are you kidding me? My friend had a daughter the same time I had my son. She’s been cute her whole life. When she would sneeze, she’d announce it. “I gotta sneeze, Mommy. I need a napkin.” Her mom would run over with a napkin. “Here you go, baby. Put your nose in the napkin.” “I gotta sneeze, Mom. I gotta sneeze.” [soft sneeze] It’s fucking beautiful. Glitter. When my son sneezes, no announcement. His face just explodes, mid-conversation. It always happens at the restaurant. He’s, like, “Dad, did you see how many points…” [splat] And then I still help him. I grab a napkin. “Here, wipe your face, Joe.” Because I’m a good dad. Let me do that with my mom when I was a kid. Shit. At the dinner table. “Mom, can you pass a…” [splat] “Are you fucking kidding me? Are your hands broken when you sneeze? When you sneeze, you can’t use your fucking hands? You could not go like that? Now there’s boogers on the chicken. You’re eating all the booger chicken, Joseph. All of that is yours. Enjoy boogers and chicken. Delicious, huh?” The whole week, I gotta eat booger chicken sandwiches at school. And she’d make fun of me. “How was your sandwich? Salty, huh? Cover your mouth.”',\n",

Why? Because he’s a boy. Boys don’t leave the fucking house. They don’t leave. How do I know that? Because I didn’t leave the house. I didn’t leave the house till I was 28. “I ain’t leaving. My mom can cook.” And I’m ready for that. Now, if I had a daughter, I wouldn’t put a dime away. Not a penny. Not a cent. Why? Because girls mature quicker, they grow up faster, and they get the fuck out of the house! “Don’t talk to me like that, Mom! That’s bullshit! I’m a fucking woman! Don’t touch me, Dad.”',\n",

And the reason why I know is because I have two sisters… Gemma and Rowena. Both of them left at 18, and neither one of them came back. That’s some gangster shit. My sister Rowena was the first one to go. Had a full-time job at Wendy’s. Swear to God. Shift supervisor. She thought she was a fucking millionaire! Showed me her paychecks every week. “Look at this shit. I’m rich.” And she was ready. Got into the last fight with my mom in the living room. She had it. “Whatever, Mom. I’m going. I’m getting the fuck out of here. I’m sick of these fucking rules. I’m old enough to take care of myself. And you know what? Me and Brian, we’ve been looking for a place, and when we find it, I’m fucking out of here!” And my mom just looked at her and goes, “Are you fucking crazy? Get the fuck out of here right now.” And my sister didn’t even flinch. “Fine! Fuck it! I’m out of here!” And she left. My sister left at 18 and never came back. That’s some gangster shit. I remember that day like it was yesterday. She was in the garage, loading the trunk of her car with all her shit, and I was upstairs in my room. And then my sister yelled up to my room, “I love you so much, Joe!” And I started crying. And I looked at my mom. I go, “She’s gonna die! She’s gonna die, Mom!” And my mom looked at me and goes, “Well, then let her die. You want to die with her, Joseph?” “I don’t want to die!” And she left, and she never came back. Then my other sister, Gemma, 18… left. She never came back.',\n",
       " 'My sisters are the shit. The shit! Because I didn’t leave till I was 28. Twenty-eight! And even then I wasn’t sure I was ready to go. I swear to God. I remember standing at the doorway with a garbage bag full of my clothes, and I looked at my mom. I go, “Mom, are you sure you want me to leave?” And my mom goes, “Yes, Joseph. It’s time. It’s time for you to be a man now, Joseph. Now move to the garage.” And I moved to the garage like a fucking man. Twenty-eight. And then I moved back in at 29. It was cold in that garage. I go, “Mom, there’s no insulation in the garage.” And my mom let me back in. “Come back in here, Joseph.” That’s what she always does. I always had second, third chances. “Come back in here, Joseph. I was just joking. I thought you were the comedian.”',\n",
       " 'And I moved back in at 29. And then I moved out again at 32. But fuck it. That’s what boys do. Shit. My sisters never got a second chance. Once they were gone, that was it. She didn’t give a shit. “Bye. Don’t even call me. You think you can do it? Oh, go. Do it. It’s cold out there, huh?” My sisters would get into epic fights with my mom. Like, some of the shit they would say… unbelievable. I remember watching those fights when I was a kid. My sister Rowena, especially. Holy shit. Every weekend. “Mom, I’m going out with my friend. Why do you always question me every time I go out with my friend?” “Yeah. Because every weekend, it’s a different guy.” “Yeah, Mom, it’s called dating. I’m dating people. I’m allowed to do that. I don’t go to school anymore. I make my own money. I want to go out and date and have fun. Is that a big deal?” “Yeah, but you go out every weekend, just gallivanting with different people all the time.” “They’re not different people! They’re my friends!” “Sure, they’re you’re friends. They’re just people out there. You’re giving your pekpek away to everybody! You don’t even know them. Who wants pekpek? You want pekpek? That’s a pekpek for you. You want it? There! It’s for free!” “Pekpek” is “pussy.” There’s some people that got it, but then there’s some, like, “Is she giving chickens away? Every weekend, she has a chicken and she gives it away? That’s expensive.” But now they made up. Now they’re friends. Best of friends. Seeing my mom and sister make up: Funniest shit ever. Just seeing my mom cry. “I just want you to know that… I didn’t think you gave your pekpek away to everybody.” “Well, I didn’t, Mom. It’s right here. It’s the same one you gave me.”',\n",
       " 'Man, I get it, Mom. God bless you. That shit is hard. My son’s 13, and it just keeps getting harder and harder. It’s so hard. My son is in the seventh grade. God damn it. I want all you new parents to know this right now. When you were in the seventh grade and you weren’t smart, you’re definitely not gonna be smart when your kid gets to the seventh grade. It’s harder. My son and I are failing Math. It’s so hard. Now he’s getting a C-minus in Math. C-minus in Math. In private school, that’s not good. That’s failing Math. So, of course, she brings me in for a parent-teacher meeting. Private school. That’s what they do. They sit you down because they’re concerned. “Hi. [chuckles] Mr. Koy. Mr. Koy, please sit down. I don’t want to startle you. I want to nip this in the bud. Just want you to know, Mr. Koy, that your son has a C-minus in Math. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. That’s not good. What are we gonna do to solve that, Mr. Koy? You need to help me help him. I can do whatever I can over here at school, but when he gets home, you need to crack open that book and start working on those questions with your son. Let’s bring that grade back up. Let’s do this as a team, Mr. Koy. Come on!” And I was, like, “You know I’m a comedian, right? And I hired you to teach my son math. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. What are we gonna do to fix that? Sounds like you owe me money.”',\n",
       " 'If you have kids, take them to public school. That’s the only… Public school, please. I’m paying college tuition for my son’s seventh-grade education. And then I get a call from the principal. “Mr. Koy, you forgot to pay your milk fee. You forgot to pay your milk fee, Mr. Koy.” I go, “I paid the tuition. I thought it was included in the tuition.” “No, Mr. Koy, that’s separate.” I got so mad. I was filling out that paperwork, and I just looked at my son. I go, “I can’t believe I’m filling out paperwork to pay for milk.” He goes, “What are you talking about, Dad?” I go, “When I filled out paperwork, it was so I can get free milk. We were poor, Joe. We couldn’t afford milk, so my mom filled out paperwork so we could get a free milk. I couldn’t wait to get to school so I could actually taste calcium. And it’s delicious when it’s free.” He didn’t know what a free milk was, so I had to explain to him what a free milk looked like. I go, “Joe, a free milk was a carton of milk that looked like a house from Monopoly. And it had three simple instructions. You pulled the right side to the right, the left side to the left, and then you pinched the middle and pulled it towards your chest, and it’s supposed to make a spout. But it never made a fucking spout. So, you turned it to the back and started over. That side had too much glue. You couldn’t even open that fucking side. So you just ripped it open in the middle. Now you’re drinking milk out of a square box. And when you were done with that milk, you put soil in it and a bean, and you grew a tree.”',\n",
       " 'Yeah. Public school. I gotta get my son to be humble. How is my son gonna be humble when I’ve been driving him to school? His whole school career, he’s been chauffeured to school. He’s never been on a bus before. That shit will make you humble. Go to school on a public bus. He doesn’t even know what a public bus… I just found out my son doesn’t know what a school bus is. We were driving on the freeway, and a school bus passed us, and my son goes like this: “Where are they going?” “Fucking school, asshole. Who’s this dick?” He’s been going to school… You gotta go to school on a bus. That shit will make you humble. Go to school on a bus with a bunch of kids that hate their fucking life. That was me. I hated my life. I was the last kid on, and I was the last kid off. Hated that shit. Every time I got on, there was only one seat left, and there was always that one kid that didn’t want to share the seat. And I’d walk up to him. He’s, like, “You better not even think about sitting here.” And I’d go, “Where am I supposed to sit?” “I don’t fucking care.” And the bus driver doesn’t give a shit. “You’d better sit down back there.” “I don’t know where to sit. He’s not gonna let me sit down. She’s getting mad. She’s not gonna go unless I sit down. I won’t even sit on the whole thing. Just let me… let me sit on the edge.” I had to sit on the edge and then hold the seat across the aisle. I went to school looking like I took a shit on the bus. And then he’d still fuck with me. “Why do you smell like Vicks?” “Because I have pneumonia.”',\n",
       " 'He’s got it so good. I’ve got to stop spoiling him. I spoil him too much. It sucks. But the reason I spoil him is because I didn’t have shit when I was a kid. We were broke as shit. And now that I can afford it, I’m buying everything. And yes, it’s for him, but he doesn’t know that it’s actually for us. All that cool shit he has, I want it, too. I want it so bad. This Christmas pissed me off. I go, “Joe, you want a PS4 for Christmas?” He goes, “No.” I go, “Why the fuck not? You’re selfish, bro.” I want all that shit. I want all those toys. And I’m holding back, but it’s hard. It’s so damn hard. We went to the mall. This was, like, seven months ago, eight months ago. And the kiosk with the hoverboards. Oh, shit. And my son got on it like a fucking natural. He just got on and was, like, “Oh, my God. Dad. Dad. Dad! Dad! I’ve got to have this, Dad. I’ve got to have this.” And I just looked at him, and this is what I said in my head. I go, “Yes, we do.” But I was being a good dad. I was, like, “No. I can’t buy that for you.” He goes, “Why not?” I go, “Because you have a C-minus in Math, and I can’t reward you for that. Bring the grade up to a B, and I’ll buy it for you.” My son goes like this: “Are you serious right now?” And this is what I said, I swear to God. I went like this: “I know, right? Why’d you fail the test, man?” We both left that mall just fucking crying. I wanted that hoverboard so bad. And then I told him, “Joe, I’ll buy you that hoverboard. I’m gonna get you a tutor, and she’s gonna help you with your math. You bring the grade up, it’s done.” So, I get the tutor. This is how shitty of a dad I am. Just for one week with the tutor, he has a quiz the following week. Four out of five right. Doesn’t even apply to the grade. And I just looked at him like this: “Look at you, Einstein. Looks like we need to go to the mall and get something, don’t we?” And I got that hoverboard. Oh, I fucking love that thing. I ride it every morning. [bleeping sounds] “You want cereal?” “Yes, Dad.” “I’ll be right back.” [bleeping sounds] I crashed on that hoverboard. Holy shit. I got wood floors at my house. This is what it sounded like when I crashed. Twice, because I skipped across the floor. And this is how old I am. When I finally landed, this is what I said. I went, “Uhh! Oh, fucking hip! Oh, my fucking hip! It’s broken!” And my son doesn’t give two shits about me. He came around the corner and went like this: “Dad? Where’s my hoverboard?” “Fuck you, Joe. Fuck you.”\\nDon’t buy that hoverboard. I don’t even know why they sell it in America. I don’t know how they got past inspection. They’re dangerous. When the battery’s dead, it doesn’t even tell you. I swear to God, it just stops mid-ride. And then it catapults you across the living room at 17 miles per hour. I’m flying through the air with a bowl of cereal, like, “What the fuck?! Shit!”',\n",

I hate it. “Have a good day at school.” He’s like this: “All right.” And I… I don’t know what to do now. Turning into a man. I don’t like the way God tells you that your son is turning into a man. It’s too quick. I’m not even mentally prepared for this. I found out last year that he’s turning into a man. It sucked. Last year… This is when I found out. He was in the pool, swimming, and I’m on the outside of the pool, just watching my son swim. He comes out of the pool. This is what he says to me, word-for-word, when he comes out of the pool. He went like this: “This pubic hair is tickling my butt.” And when he said “pubic hair,” he meant one pubic hair. Just one. It’s so long, it’s tickling his asshole. And I started crying. I go, “Why do you have a pubic hair? Why?” And that’s it. That’s it. The pube is here. That was last year. He’s 13 now. How many does he have now, 20? I’m not ready for that.',\n",

Now! This is when it starts! Thirteen. This is when it starts. Shit! And I’m gonna catch him. I’m gonna catch him. It’s inevitable. I’m gonna catch my son jerking off. Are you kidding me?

I would do that with any stranger, Joseph. White, black, Latino, Asian. I don’t care. If I don’t know you, put my purse in the room. That’s a Louis Vuitton.” I go, “Mom, you know what you did.

       " ['sicko is not about the  million americans who dont have health insurance its about some of the  million who havehad health insurance and in spite of this their lives were ruined it dispels a lot of the myths espoused by some in america such as long waiting lines higher taxes and the doctors being paid close to nothing it explains why hmos were established and how their primary purpose is to deny claims advancement in these companies is based upon how many claims an employee denies and any claims that are actually paid out are seen as failures director and writer michael moore goes to countries like canada england france and cuba and talks to citizens of these countries to get their take on their countrys healthcare system he also goes to hospitals and emergency rooms in these countries to get the take of the people there and when he ask how much do you pay they all laugh at him moore sums up the premise of film when he says the rest of the western world practices we healthcare while americans practice me healthcare this is probably one of the most depressing movies ever filmed bowling for columbine doesnt even hold a candle to the disheartening realizations contained in this film you will be left with a sick taste in your mouth having been reminded of how disgusting and heartless the usa bottom line policy making is how sick it is to be imprisoned by the government through healthcare how the healthcare system will tear down every other joy in the citizens life until late life working  hours a week to pay the cost of staying alive unable to stand against the rich or have the hope left to vote thus the propaganda arm of the american dream prevails    george w bush we got issue in america too many good docs are getting out of business too many obgyns arent able to practice their their love with women all across the country adam  i dont have a job i dont want to have any more debt out to anybody else im flushing the wound michael moore  this is adam he had an accident hes one of the nearly  million americans with no health insurance sicko but this film isnt about adam so this is the table saw it was spinning that way this is rick i was gripping a piece of wood and i grabbed it here and it hit a knot he sawed off the tops of to of his fingers and it was that quick his first thought i dont have insurance am i gonna have to pay cash for this    or more does that mean were not gonna get a car rick also doesnt have health coverage so the hospital gave him a choice reattach the middle finger for  or do the ring finger for  its an awful feeling to just try to put a value on your body being a hopeless romantic rick chose the ring finger for the bargain price of  grand the top of his middle finger now enjoys its new home in an oregon landfill i can do that thing where you know the old man used to pull the finger off michael moore but this movie isnt about rick either yes there are nearly  million americans with no health insurance they pray every day they dont get sick because  of them will die this year simply because theyre uninsured but this movie isnt about them its about the  million of you who have health insurance those of you who are living the american dream its moving day for larry and donna smith theyve packed everything they own in these to cars and are driving to denver colorado to their new home hi hello narrator in their daughters storage room this is home sweet home look at all that stuff well get everything organized we will what do we do with the computer it stays it stays there so this is where heather talked about we might have to put bunk beds i see what shes talking about narrator it wasnt supposed to end up like this for larry and donna they both had good jobs she was a newspaper editor and he was a union machinist they raised six kids who all went to fine schools like the university of chicago but larry had a heart attack and then another one and then another one and then donna got cancer and even though they had health insurance the copays and deductibles soon added up to the point where they could no longer afford to keep their home if somebody told me ten years ago this was gonna happen to us because of healthcare i would have said its not possible  not in the united states we wouldnt let that happen to people  are we gonna quit no its just hard narrator they were bankrupt so they moved in with their daughter well get it all figured out we emptied the dresser so you have a spot nice very nice even their son danny popped in from across town to welcome them to denver what do we do about people like you – i dont know thats a good question youre supposed to pay a deductible for  i understand thats healthcare what about people like kathy and i that have to come up there and move you every five years every two years every year – cause you dont have enough money thats what russell says too im sorry its not what we wanted to have happen in life and were doing what we can to make the change you dont know what that feels like inside at  years old to have to reach out to my  for help its gonna be hard for four five six seven months its gonna be hard i have a feeling of you bring your problems with you no matter where you go yeah but i dont know what to do about that by sheer coincidence their daughters husband paul was leaving on a job the very same day they arrived paul was a contractor but there werent many jobs lately so he found work out of town im sure youll keep a telephone conversation email you youre gonna be just fine lovies weird situation isnt it – tell me where daddys going – iraq why is daddy going to iraq to do some plumbing oh boy this i do early in the morning the first thing i do is i clean here at age  frank cardile should be kicking back on a beach somewhere but even though hes insured by medicare it doesnt cover all the cost of the drugs that he and his wife need being that im an employee here my medicine is for free so thats why i gotta keep working until i die there is nothing wrong with that ok i always gotta keep my ears open because theres always spillages sometimes you get a gallon of milk tomato sauce – oh youre in trouble itll take a halfhour to clean that up and i look up on every aisle so as everything is clean if i see something i pick it up whether its paper or garbage one day i had the keys in my hand and they went in there and i had to climb in there to get the keys out its a sad situation if there are golden years i cant find em ill tell you that she had a painkiller for her hip the girl said frank this is   what for a painkiller i didnt take it i backed off i said i gotta come back  whats in them whats in these new drugs that they distribute i dont believe you need half of the things they tell you i have never taken medication now as im getting older i dont even like to take an aspirin i do like a little brandy i dont really know how this happened but the trunk came forward into the back seat narrator laura burnham was in a headon collision that knocked her out cold paramedics got her out of the car and into an ambulance for a trip to the hospital i get a bill from my insurance company telling me that the ambulance ride was not going to be paid for because it wasnt preapproved i dont know exactly when i was supposed to preapprove it you know like after i gain consciousness in the car before i got in the ambulance i should have grabbed my cellphone off the street and called in the ambulance i mean its just crazy i applied for healthnet insurance for jason they rejected him because of his height and weight jason is six feet tall and  pounds i applied for healthcare through bluecross blueshield and they told me that my body mass index was too high im ′   i weigh  pounds narrator i always thought health insurance companies were there to help us so i posted a n',\n",
       "  'ote on the internet asking people if they had had any similar stories about problems with their insurance company within  hours i had over  responses and by the end of the week over  people had sent me their healthcare horror stories some of them decided not to wait for me to get back to them like doug noe who took matters into his own hands without my permission his daughter was nine months old when they discovered she was going deaf his health insurance company cigna said theyd pay for an implant in only one of her ears according to the letter they sent its experimental for her to hear in two ears if a cochlear implant is good for one ear it doesnt even make any sense that it wouldnt be good for the second ear especially when a child is just starting to learn how to talk she has to learn from both sides of her head thats when he sat down to write cigna a letter this is to cigna noted filmmaker michael moore is in the process of gathering information for his next film  ive sent information concerning cignas lack of caring for its policy holders  has your ceo ever been in a film before narrator before he knew it he received a call on his voice mail from cigna tuesday  am obviously all this worked because annette is going to get her second implant in july dear mike i work in the industry  i work for an hmo i started to get hundreds of letters of a different sort from people who work inside the healthcare industry theyd seen everything and they were fed up with it health insurance companies suck flat suck  narrator like becky malke who was in charge of keeping sick people away from one of americas top insurance companies becky malke health insurance salesperson i worked in a call center so people call in and ask for insurance quotes there are certain preexisting conditions basically industrywide that will not be covered – diabetes heart disease certain forms of cancer if you have these conditions you are likely not going to get your health insurance how long is this list of conditions that make you ineligible it would be a really long list it would be a long list it could wrap around this house sometimes you know theyre gonna be declined at the end of the application and theyre like god like one time i had a couple and they were so happy to get im gonna cry they were so happy that they were i took them through this application and the husband was late for work and the wife said to him dont worry baby its gonna be ok we have health insurance now  and when i looked i could tell they were gonna get declined because of their health conditions and they were so happy i thought god theyre gonna get that call in a couple of weeks telling them that theyre not eligible for insurance i just felt so bad cause i just really thought and i knew and i couldnt say anything to them i just felt like crap thats why im such a bitch on the phone to people because i dont wanna get to know them i dont wanna know about their lives i just wanna get in and out and get done with it cause i cant take the stress of it narrator in spite of becky being a bit of a pain on the phone a quarter billion americans are still able to get health insurance lets meet some of these happy insured customers maria has blueshield and diane horizon bluecross bcs insures laurel and caroline has cigna and its a good thing that theyre all fully covered i ended up being diagnosed with retroperitoneal cancer brain tumor breast cancer brain tumor on the right temporal lobe narrator as they were insured they got the redcarpet treatment at the doctors office she requested for me to see a neurologist the way they would treat it was to remove it surgery was scheduled for december  there is a test that you can take that will show whether or not you would benefit from chemo narrator they got their treatment but not before battling their insurance companies investigated whether or not this was a preexisting condition its not medically necessary  they claim that its experimental we dont consider that lifethreatening narrator diane died from her non lifethreatening tumor laurels cancer is now spread throughout her body her experimental test proved that caroline needed chemo while vacationing in japan maria became ill and got the mri that blueshield of california had refused to approve the doctors in japan told her she had a brain tumor blueshield had said repeatedly she didnt have a tumor thats when she said well im pretty sure i have a lawyer  march   im gonna direct your attention to exhibit one please describe for me what it is it is a denial for referral to an ophthalmologist is it your signature on this yes id like to direct your attention to exhibit two this is a denial of a request for referral for a magnetic resonance imaging test of the brain it has your signature yes directing your attention to exhibit three please read this document this is a denial of a referral to a neurosurgeon can you explain for me how you came to sign the denial letter this is a standard signature put on all denial letters is it your signature or a stamp that is a stamp did you ever see a denial letter before your signature was stamped on it no but the denial letters are fundamentally the same the denial letters that are sent out – the answer is no – no all right the definition of a good director was somebody who saves the company money narrator dr linda peeno was a medical reviewer for humana she left her job because she didnt like their way of doing business i was told when i started that i had to keep a  denial then they were giving us reports weekly that would have all the cases we reviewed the percent approved and the percent denied and our actual percentage denial rate then there would be another report that compared me to all the other reviewers the doctor with the highest percent of denials was gonna get a bonus really so you as a doctor working for the hmo if you denied more people healthcare you got a bonus that was how they set it up any payment for a claim is referred to as a medical loss thats the terminology the industry uses i mean when you dont spend money on somebody you deny their care or you make a decision that brings money in and you dont have to spend it its a savings to the company narrator this is tarsha harris bluecross didnt deny her her treatment and actually approved her operation but then they discovered that in the distant past she had had a yeast infection apparently its common men women can get a yeast infection so i was prescribed the yeast infection cream general cream and it went away she later applied for health insurance and thats what youre supposed to be disclosing – serious ailments the yeast infection is not a serious ailment there was nothing she could have done it wasnt until they were gonna have to spend money that they looked if theyd taken five minutes and wanted to clear up the yeast infection they couldve looked at her records or talked to her doctor narrator because of the undisclosed yeast infection bluecross dropped tarsha harris she thinks shes put this behind her and then bluecross changes their mind tells the doctors were taking the money back go get the money from tarsha the fact of the matter is it was a yeast infection thats all it was im still a little bitter because i dont trust insurance companies now to me it seems theyre always gonna be looking for a way out what happened to helping the person thats sick dont make their problems worse narrator this is lee einer if they werent able to weed you out in the application process or deny you the care your doctor said you needed and somehow ended up paying for the operation they send in lee their hitman his job is to get the companys money back any way he can all he has to do is find one slipup on your application or a preexisting condition you didnt know you had lee einer',\n",
       "  ' were gonna go after this like its a murder case and i mean the whole unit dedicated to going through your health history for the last five years looking for anything that would indicate that you concealed something you misrepresented something so that they can cancel the policy or jack the rates so high that you cant pay them and if we couldnt find anything you didnt disclose on the application you can still get hit with a preexisting denial because you dont even have to have sought medical treatment for it in some states its legal to have a prudent person preexisting condition and thats a mouthful i know but what that says is if prior to your insurance kicking in you had any symptom which would incline a normally prudent person to have sought medical care then the condition of which that symptom was a symptom is excluded i know its labyrinthine isnt it but thats how it works theyre supposed to be evenhanded but with an insurance company its their frigging money so its not unintentional its not a mistake its not an oversight youre not slipping through the cracks somebody made that crack and swept you towards it and the intent is to maximize profits looking back i dont know that i killed anybody did i do harm in peoples lives yeah hell yeah i havent worked for insurance companies for a long time and i dont think that really serves to atone for my participation in that mess i am glad im out of it though narrator julie pierce was struggling to get care for her husband tracy who was suffering from kidney cancer julie works in the intensive care unit at st josephs medical center in kansas city missouri which provided her family with health insurance every month there was a new drug that the doctor wanted to try my insurance denied it one letter might say not a medical necessity one letter might say its not for this particular type of cancer and they denied it then we came up with the bone marrow it has showed to stop it sometimes to completely get rid of it tracys doctors said this treatment had been successfully tried on many other patients if one of tracys brothers turned out to be a suitable donor there were promising bone marrow treatments for beating tracys cancer two weeks later the bone marrow nurse at ku called me and she goes weve got the results back his youngest brother is a perfect donor match  we were ecstatic you know i think thats the happiest i had seen him in a while so we submitted it and they denied it said it was experimental  so i found out that there is a board of trustees over our medical plan that actually work at my hospital and they are the final decisionmakers on what gets approved and what doesnt narrator julie and her husband and their son tracy junior demanded a meeting with the health plans board of trustees the very people who had the power to approve their claim they told julie that they were sympathetic to her situation i said your sympathy does me no good when im burying him next year  and i told them i said if i was bruce van cleve was our ceo i said i bet if it was bruce van cleves wife it would get approved  no its nothing like that  i said or maybe if my husband was white  and i got up and walked out of the room when we got home i found him up in the bathroom and i knocked on the door and said what are you doing in there nothing  i opened the door cause usually hell say what do you think im doing in here and he was sitting in there and he was crying and he said why me im a good person  and i said but were not done fighting this  were strong yeah  and then he said you know he goes i can see now that im gonna die  he said i can leave everything but i dont want to leave you and tracy  the doctor told me he would die in three weeks and on january  which was my birthday he went to sleep and he died five days later here at home he was my best friend he was my soul mate he was my sons father i mean we were to grow old together they took away everything that matters i wanna know why why my husband why wasnt he given the chance to live you preach these vision and values that we care for the sick the dying the poor that were a healthcare that leaves no one behind you left him behind you didnt even give him a start it was as if he was nothing and i want them to have a conscience about it and i dont think they do i dont think it has fazed them one bit at all narrator there was one person in the healthcare industry who did have a conscience dr linda peeno a former medical reviewer at humana linda peeno my name is linda peeno i am here today to make a public confession in the spring of  as a physician i denied a man a necessary operation that would have saved his life and thus caused his death no person and no group has held me accountable for this because in fact what i did was i saved the company a half a million dollars for this and furthermore this particular act secured my reputation as a good medical director and it insured my continued advancement in the healthcare field i went from making a few hundred dollars a week as a medical reviewer to an escalating sixfigure income as a physician executive in all my work i had one primary duty and that was to use my medical expertise for the financial benefit of the organization for which i worked and i was told repeatedly that i was not denying care i was simply denying payment i know how managed care maims and kills patients so im here to tell you about the dirty work of managed care and im haunted by the thousands of pieces of paper on which i have written that deadly word – denied  thank you narrator how did we get to the point of doctors at health insurance companies actually being responsible for the deaths of patients who invented this system how did this all begin where did the hmo start thanks to the wonders of magnetic tape we know i am proposing today a new national health strategy the purpose of this program is simply this – i want america to have the finest healthcare in the world and i want every american to be able to have that care when he needs it  narrator the plan hatched beteen nixon and edgar kaiser worked in the ensuing years patients were given less and less care bigger logjams at the nearby hospital and less quality medical care been here about  hours since  this morning what looks cramped and unsightly can also be dangerous narrator while health insurance companies became wealthy the system was broken  million americans are without protection against catastrophic illness the losers are the poor who may now postpone urgent healthcare until its too late narrator this went on for years until this man rode into town bringing with him his little lady sassy smart sexy some men couldnt handle it today i am announcing the formation of the presidents task force on national health reform chaired by the first lady hillary rodham clinton narrator hillary clinton decided to make healthcare for everyone her top priority universal coverage now it will not depend upon where you work whether you work or if you have a preexisting condition healthcare that can never be taken away some republicans complain mrs clinton is getting a free ride its fairly risky business what president clinton did to put his wife in charge of some big policy program and while i dont share the chairmans joy at our holding hearings on a governmentrun healthcare system i do share his intention to make the debate and the legislative process as exciting as possible – im sure you will do that mr armey – well do the best we can – you and dr kevorkian i think i have been told about your charm and wit and let me say reports on your charm are overstated – and reports on your wit are understated thank you thank you very much narrator she drove washington insane do you want the government to control your healthcare you wont have the choice of your own do',\n",
       "  'ctors less government more control more government less control for you and your family when your mama gets sick she might talk to a bureaucrat instead of a doctor this is a total mess and its about to get messier not this bureaucratic socialistic plan that they have socialist takeover socialized medicine what really amounts to a giant social experiment narrator ooh socialized medicine nothing put more fear in us than the thought of that and the chief fearmongers against socialized medicine have always been the good doctors of the american medical association this would put the government smack into your hospital defining services setting standards establishing committees calling for reports deciding who gets in and who gets out after all the government has to treat everyone fair and equal dont you know take us all the way down the road to a new system of medicine for everybody narrator yes medicine for everyone the ama didnt want that and to drive the point home further they held thousands of coffeeklatsches all over the country where they invited their neighbors to come and listen to a record made by a wellknown actor on the evils of socialized medicine ronald reagan my name is ronald reagan one of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine the doctor begins to lose freedoms its like telling a lie and one leads to another a doctor decides he wants to practice in one town the government says to him you cant live in that town they already have enough doctors you have to go someplace else  all of us can see what happens once you establish the precedent that the government can determine a mans working place and his methods and behind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day we will awake to find that we have socialism the white house said to tone down the rhetoric reacting to burning an effigy of hillary clinton narrator the times may have changed but the scare tactics hadnt the healthcare industries spent over a hundred million dollars to defeat hillarys healthcare plan and they succeeded and i want now to introduce to you the president because he loves the easter egg roll narrator for the next seven years in the white house she wasnt allowed to bring it up again is anybody here older than two narrator a decade and a half went by and still america had no universal health plan the united states slipped to number  in healthcare around the world just slightly ahead of slovenia but thats understandable because congress was busy with other matters mr speaker today i rise to offer congratulations to the confectioners at just born incorporated as they celebrate the  anniversary of one of their most recognized and celebrated products not to mention my daughters favorite marshmallow peeps narrator and thus the healthcare industry went unchecked into the  st century humana more than doubles its fourth quarter profit lifts its earning for the year united health has tripled its share prices narrator making obscene profits betterthanexpected earnings theres a lot of wealthy shareholders out there are they willing to share some of that wealth narrator turning their ceos into billionaires and skirting the law whenever they wanted but their biggest accomplishment was buying our united states congress this is washington at work lobbying has become so brazen narrator with four times as many healthcare lobbyists than there are members of congress they even managed to buy off old foes for her silence hillary was rewarded and she became the second largest recipient in the senate of healthcare industry contributions weve given the entire healthcare system over to the insurance industry and they have total control narrator well not total control the drug companies like to buy their members of congress too heres what it costs to buy these men and this woman this guy and this guy and him too ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states narrator and the biggest check was saved for last why did they hand out all this cash they wanted a bill passed – a bill to help seniors with their prescriptions let there be no mistake about it republicans love their mothers their fathers and their grandparents as much as anybody else on this hill and were gonna take care of them in this country narrator of course it was really a bill to hand over  billion of our tax dollars to the drug and health insurance industry by letting the drug companies charge whatever they wanted and making the private health insurance companies the middleman everybody was going to get their cut the man they appointed to get the job done was congressman billy tauzin he was the right man for the job because he had a secret weapon billy tauzin theres no one in this house loves their mother more than i love my mother i challenge you on that sir nobody in this body that loves their mother any more or any less than any one of us i love that woman do you think for a second you love your moms and dads any more than we love ours do you think republicans and democrats who will vote do you really believe that mr stoddard god bless you narrator oh they all loved their mothers its just that they didnt love our mothers as much now im honored and pleased to sign this historic piece of legislation – the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  narrator what they didnt tell us was that the elderly could end up paying more for their prescriptions than they did before over to thirds of senior citizens could still pay over   a year and when it was over  congressional aids who worked on the bill quit their jobs on the hill and went to work for the healthcare industry as did one congressman  cause ive got a golden ticket narrator billy tauzin left congress to become the ceo of phrma the drug industry lobby for a salary of   million a year oh it was a happy day in washington many americans knew they were never going to see universal healthcare and thats why some of them decided to look elsewhere for help were driving across the detroit river back there is the renaissance center you can see it general motors headquarters downtown detroit the skyline you get a really nice view from driving over the bridge narrator this is adrian campbell a single mother who at the age of  came down with cancer i got cervical cancer and i was denied through the insurance company they said were not paying for it because youre  and you dont have  you shouldnt be having cervical cancer youre too young  narrator forced into debt but now cancer free adrian was fed up with the american healthcare system she had a new plan i have everything ready before i even hit the border i got my passports ready i got my money out its three dollars and  cents to get across one way and i got everything just sitting up here on my visor just ready to go aurora be very quiet citizenships us where do you live michigan thats not on right no narrator she may live in michigan but ten blocks across the border adrian becomes a canadian how long have you been living here three months a couple i havent applied for the ohip card yet – i still have mine it takes ten minutes thats fine i dont mind ok thank you i put down kyles address at the clinic and when they ask you know what my relationship is i put down that i was his commonlaw partner i dont like to lie and i dont like liars its little white lies but its you know im saving the money you dont bring a checkbook when you go to the hospital here its provided to us its something you dont have to worry about or go out of your way to get stress free they called the cops narrator the presence of our camera alerted the clinic that something was up and i dont think im gonna get seen now so i have another idea im gonna g',\n",
       "  'o down to the other clinic there is a clinic down one that we passed the police showed up over there look yes narrator what adrian was doing was illegal but were americans we go into other countries when we need to its tricky but its allowed its kind of frustrating having i mean just get married and thatd solve everything – shed be covered americans marry canadians just for the healthcare im being used narrator sounds like a good idea see if it works start something start a trend in canada they give everybody free healthcare – doesnt it work up there no unfortunately it doesnt we wait months to get treatment you can get in a week or a few days here in canada you have to wait nine to ten months for bypass surgery many canadians believe its the healthcare system itself thats truly sick they pay their doctors less a surgeon can only do a certain number of operations each year with only so many expensive new pieces of equipment its easier for your cat or dog to receive an mri here in america you die of cancer waiting for chemo cause all of ottawa has one chemo machine if you think socialized medicine is a good idea ask a canadian narrator so i thought who better to ask than my canadian relatives bob and estelle but they wouldnt cross the border into america they wanted me to meet them at sears in canada what are you guys doing here were buying insurance were going to the states to see you right thats just across the river yeah you wouldnt go over to see us in michigan for a couple of hours without insurance no we wouldnt were just adamant about it we would not do it if somebody punches us in the mouth or something something like that you dont want to get caught in the american health system thing we have nothing against americans or america or anything like that at all were a nice and simple people not very simple but certainly very nice i decided to explore their antiamerican views further over some fine canadian cuisine we have a friend who went to hawaii and he sustained a head injury while he was there and before he was well enough to come home he had chalked up a bill of over  so what middleclass canadian could absorb that i guess i feel bad that you would have to worry about something like that were not criticizing your country were just giving you the facts that we could not afford to be without insurance even for a day even for a day to prove their point even further they sent me over to a local golf course to talk to larry godfrey who had a golfing accident while on vacation in florida i could hear a noise and feel a pain and the tendon snapped off this bone here that holds the bicep in place so this bicep muscle was released like on an elastic and it ended up here on my chest – the muscle ended up in your chest right ended up here like all good golfers larry finished his round before seeking medical attention thats when he got the bad news i wasnt too worried as i had outofcountry insurance but when he told me it was  or  then i  dollars yes so if youd stayed in the united states this would have cost you   instead you went back to canada and canada paid your total expenses everything paid for the operation it cost you nothing zero zero zero im wondering why you expect your fellow canadians who dont have your problem why should they through their tax dollars have to pay for a problem you have because we would do the same for them its just the way its always been and its the way we hope itll always be right but if you just had to pay for your problem and dont pay for everybody elses problem just take care of yourself well there are a lot of people who arent in a position to be able to do that and somebody has to look after them are you a member of the socialist party no no green party no well actually im a member of the conservative party is that bad – well its just a little confusing well it shouldnt be i think that where medical matters are concerned it wouldnt matter in canada what party you were affiliated with if any but to us as we look across the river here you know why dont you think we dont believe that whats wrong on this issue with us i guess the powers that be dont share our beliefs that healthcare ought to be universal i mean canadians didnt until we met up with a guy named tommy douglas who pretty much changed everyones mind – one guy one guy yeah one guy did it he can he come over and visit us hes dead unfortunately in fact he was hes just most recently been revered as canadas singular most important person we think so much of you mean in your history in our whole history more than your first prime minister absolutely yeah even more than wayne gretzky no way absolutely yeah more than céline dion great singer more than céline yeah more than rocky and bullwinkle maybe as the blade went through it caught the glove i was wearing and it sliced through the entire group of fingers completely taking them off and i realized that i needed help immediately obviously putting on amputated fingers or arms or limbs is one of the more dramatic things we can do if youre looking at five fingers youre looking at a  operation there actually was four surgeons as well as all the nurses and two different anesthetists to carry out an operation of that magnitude when brad came in we didnt have to worry about whether he could afford it he needed help and we could concentrate on the best way to bring him through it i met this american hed cut off the ends of two of his fingers with a saw so when he arrived at the hospital they told him one fingers gonna cost  and the other one was gonna be  he had to choose which finger he could afford down bend the long finger down weve never told someone that they couldnt put a finger back on because the system wouldnt allow it im very glad i work within a system that allows me the freedom to look after people and not have to make choices like that it seems nothing we were told about the canadian system was true maybe i was just in the wrong part of town so i went across the city to a crowded hospital waiting room how long did you have to wait here to get help –  minutes –  minutes i got helped right away you can see how crowded this is they really do an amazing job did you have to get permission to come to this hospital no no we can go anywhere we want you dont have to get it preapproved by your insurance company oh heavens no can you choose your doctor oh yes whats your deductible nothing i dont think we have any i dont know i dont think theres any as far as i know so what did this cost nothing we know in america people pay for their healthcare but i guess we dont understand that cause we dont have to deal with that and were dealing with parkinsons stroke heart attack were very very lucky really we are i mean we complain people complain about everything right right youre canadian but on the whole its a fabulous system for making sure that the least of us and the best of us are taken care of it turns out that canadians live three years longer than we do thats not hard to believe when you meet fellow americans like erik  oh england here we go erik turnbow of olympia washington saved up his whole life so that he could visit the famed abbey road crosswalk in london but it wasnt enough for erik to just walk across the road like the beatles did he had to do it his own special way heres erik about to walk on his hands across abbey road ready ugh try it again are you in pain yeah the british hospital didnt charge erik anything for his stay and only about ten bucks for all the waycool drugs they gave him youre all slung up im gonna be ok i decided to go to great britain to find out how a hospital stay could be free and drugs could cost only ten dollars if i come in here and i have a prescription and it requires  pills how much is that its  thats the standard charge  so that',\n",
       "  's what ten dollars or so – yes what if i needed  pills how much is it – same charge –  pills –  still – it doesnt matter how many pills – no – what if its an hiv drug or a cancer drug still  if they are under  or over  theyre automatically exempt so only a working adult who earns enough money pays the  everybody else gets medication free no money being exchanged here no nothing theres no money being exchanged im over  we dont pay whats the purpose of the cash register im just wondering wheres the bread and the milk and the candy in here i cant pick up any laundry detergent here no i havent been trained for that many years to be selling detergents so no    narrator i next went to a staterun hospital operated by the national health service im due in seven weeks and i get six months off paid and then i can have six months off unpaid as well so im actually taking a year well that sounds like a luxury where im from oh really its not like that in the us no not at all no so what do you pay for a stay here no one pays they were asking how do people pay i said there isnt you dont you just leave its national insurance theres no bill at the end of it as it were narrator even with insurance theres bound to be a bill somewhere – so wheres the billing department – there isnt a billing department theres no such thing what did they charge for that baby sorry you gotta pay before you can get out – no this is nhs – no no everything is on nhs you know its not america narrator maybe id have better luck in the part where things get seriously expensive this guy broke his ankle how much will this cost him the emergency room visit hell have some huge bill when hes done right here nhs everything is free im asking about hospital charges and youre laughing i was never asked this question in the emergency department thats why narrator i was starting to fall for this everything is free bit and then i discovered this so this is where people come to pay their bill when theyre done staying here no this is the nhs hospital so you dont pay the bill you get to just go home why does it say cashier here if people dont have to pay a bill all we have is a little man who stands behind a counter and he gives people money if theyve had to pay for transport those who have reduced means get their travel expenses reimbursed thank you so in british hospitals instead of money going into the cashiers window money comes out the criteria for letting you out are not if youve paid the criteria are are you fit to go and are you going somewhere safe clearly i was just the butt of a joke here what i needed was a good oldfashioned american who would have some understanding i first came to london in  and we just ended up staying and we had three children here well i had them all on the nhs which is the british national health service i think like a lot of americans assumed that a socialized medicine was just bottom of the rung treatment that the only way would be horrible and it would be like the soviet union i mean thats kind of how and its terrible that thats what i thought narrator thats what i thought too after having a baby its right back to the wheat fieldsand then it occurred to me that back home in america weve socialized a lot of things i kind of like having a police department and fire department and the library and i got to wondering why dont we have more of these free socialized things like healthcare when did this whole idea that every british citizen should have a right to healthcare well if you go back it all began with democracy before we had the vote all the power was in the hands of rich people if you had money you could get healthcare education look after yourself when you were old and what democracy did was to give the poor the vote and it moved power from the marketplace to the polling station from the wallet to the ballot and what people said was very simple they said in the  we had mass unemployment  but we dont have unemployment during the war if you can have full employment by killing germans why cant we have it by building hospitals schools recruiting nurses and teachers if you can find money to kill people you can find money to help people right this leaflet that was issued was very very straightforward what year was this this was  your new national health service begins on the  of july  what is it how do you get it it will provide you with all medical dental and nursing care  everyone rich or poor man woman or child can use it or any part of it  there are no charges except for a few special items  there is no insurance qualifications but it is not a charity  you are paying for it mainly as taxpayers and it will relieve your money worries in times of illness  now somehow the few words sum the whole thing up narrator i was amazed when he said this all started in  the british had come out of a devastating experience through world war ii the country was destroyed and nearly bankrupt they had nothing in just one eightmonth period over  civilians lost their lives what we went through in to hours on  they went through nearly every single day remember how we all felt after  all of us pulling together i guess thats how they felt and the first way that they decided to pull together after the war was to provide free medical care for everyone even mrs thatcher said the national health service is safe in our hands  its as noncontroversial as votes for women nobody could say why should women have the vote now people wouldnt have it they wouldnt in britain they wouldnt accept the deterioration or destruction of the national health service if thatcher or blair said im going to dismantle national healthcare  there would have been a revolution a report from the ama into the health of  to  says brits are far healthier than americans for every illness that we looked at americans had more of it than english cancer heart disease hypertension strokes lung disease all significantly higher for americans even the poorest people in england with all the environmental factors that give them the worst health in the country can expect to live longer than the wealthiest people in america narrator i was wondering though whats it like for the doctors here in britain who have to live under this kind of state control and youre a family doctor yeah i suppose wed call them gps or general practitioners here – right so you have a family practice – yeah its an nhs practice we have nine doctors in that practice paid for by the government yeah you work for the government youre a governmentpaid doctor a patient comes to you before you treat them do you have to call the government insurance company before you treat them no i dont deal with money at all on an everyday basis have you ever had to say no to someone who was sick and needed help no never have you heard of anyone being in the hospital and being removed because they couldnt pay their bill no never and i wouldnt want to work in that system so working for the government you probably have to use public transport no i have a car that i use and i drive to work an old beater you live in a rough part of town i live in a terrific part of town its called greenwich its a lovely house its a threestory house how many other families have to live with you theres four bedrooms for my wife and my son its just the three of us there how much did you pay for that £ yes almost so a million dollars youre a governmentpaid doctor on a national health insurance healthcare plan – and you live in a milliondollar home yes – i think my friends think we do quite well – really how well do you do i earn around £ including pension £ £ a year and that includes pension that they would pay in to me they probably earn just over £ within my practice £ so thats almost   yes absolutely the money that we earn we get paid by what we do so the bette',\n",
       "  'r we do for our patients then the more we get paid what do you mean theres a new system and in that new system if the most number of your patients have low blood pressures or you get most of your patients to stop smoking or you get your patients to have mental health reviews if theyre unwell or low cholesterols then you get paid more this year if you get more people that are your patients to stop smoking youll get more money youll earn more oh yeah absolutely so doctors in america do not have to fear having a universal healthcare no i think if you want to have two or three milliondollar homes and four or five nice cars and six or seven nice televisions then maybe yeah you need to practice somewhere where you can earn that but i think we live comfortably here london is an expensive city but i think we live comfortably youre getting by ok on the milliondollar home the audi and the flatscreen tv yeah were coping with those i think democracy is the most revolutionary thing in the world far more revolutionary than socialist ideas or anybody elses idea because if you have power you use it to meet the needs of your community and this idea of choice which capital talks about youve got to have a choice choice depends on the freedom to choose if youre shackled with debt you dont have a freedom to choose it seems it benefits the system if the average person is shackled with debt people in debt become hopeless and hopeless people dont vote they always say everyone should vote but i think if the poor in britain or the united states voted for people who represented their interests it would be a real democratic revolution so they dont want it to happen so keeping people hopeless and pessimistic see i think there are two ways in which people are controlled first of all frighten people and secondly demoralize them an educated healthy and confident nation is harder to govern and i think theres an element in the thinking of some people we dont want people to be educated healthy and confident because they would get out of control  the top   of the worlds population own  of the worlds wealth its incredible that people put up with it but theyre poor theyre demoralized theyre frightened and therefore they think perhaps the safest thing to do is to take orders and hope for the best \\xa0 and hope for the best is what we do right from the moment were born weve got the worst infant mortality rate in the western world a baby born in el salvador has a better chance of surviving than a baby born in detroit but it gets better when we go to school classrooms with  students schools with no labs no wonder the majority of our adults cant find britain on a map but thats ok theres always college by the time we graduate our ass is so in hock were in debt before our first job im at about well say about  in debt thats for my third year in college youll be the employee theyre looking for – one who needs this job   what employer wouldnt employ someone thousands of dollars in debt because they wont cause any trouble in addition to paying off your college debt you need a job with health insurance it would be horrible to lose that job wouldnt it you can always quit you know theres no law that says you have to work here if that one job doesnt pay all the bills dont worry you can get another one and another one and another one i work three jobs and i feel like i contribute you work three jobs – three jobs yes uniquely american isnt it i mean that is fantastic that youre doing that get any sleep if youre not sleeping take pharmaceuticals youre tired all the time you feel sad if you suffer from excessive worry generalized anxiety disorder it could be adult add – ask your doctor ask your doctor yes ask your doctor and ask him for more drugs that should keep you doped up until its time to retire did i say retire if you make it to  your pension will still be there unlike the new employees for these companies wholl never see a pension but im sure our kids will take care of us considering the great life weve given em remember lets defeat the terrorists over there so we dont have to fight them here kaiser permanente is the largest hmo in the country and dawnelle keyes was fortunate enough to be fully insured by them its a good thing because one night her  daughter mychelle developed a fever of over  so like any responsible mom she called  and the ambulance took mychelle to the closest hospital the hospital checked with her hmo and they were told that kaiser would not cover the tests and the antibiotics necessary to treat mychelle she would have to take her to an innetork kaiserowned hospital kaiser said that i should bring her by car to the hospital and that she shouldnt be treated at martin luther king i just continued to ask them to treat her and they refused my daughter got worse and she had a seizure dawnelle begged doctors to not listen to kaiser and to treat her daughter i was escorted out of the hospital because they felt that i was a threat after hours of delay she was transported to kaiser and got there just in time to go into cardiac arrest they worked on her for about  minutes trying to revive her and the doctors came in and let us know that she had expired i was in a daze a real daze it just didnt seem real i just held her i held her and i told her that mommy tried her best to help her to make sure that she was gonna get the treatment she needed to receive and that i was sorry that i wasnt able to help her simon says give the answer uhoh this is karena and her daughter zoë karena is a graduate of michigan state university and a native of my hometown of flint michigan six months ago zoë like dawnelles baby mychelle came down with a high fever what happened is she stopped breathing for a little while turned blue and passed out in my arms which was it was the most horrible moment in my life i think just because i thought that she was either dead or dying and i had no clue what to do at the hospital they gave her some medicine to bring the fever down and examined her took some blood what was wrong with her it was a throat infection but we stayed at the hospital from friday to sunday – just so they could keep an eye on her you stayed there that long yeah they just basically kept an eye on her and how much did all this cost you the threeplus days in the hospital nothing nothing nothing nothing at all and thats because i live in france you live in france yeah ah france they enjoy their wine their cigarettes and their fatty foods and yet just like the canadians and the brits they live much longer than we do something about that seemed grossly unfair this is alexi cremieux he spent his entire adult life in the us without health insurance i lived in america for  years i loved my life there but then when i discovered that i had a tumor and i didnt have health insurance unfortunately i had to come back here even though i had never paid taxes in france cause i never worked here i left when i was  i had no social security number – for them it was he needs treatment he has no income so were gonna give him you know the treatment he needs  how are you doing now im healthy now but i had three months of chemotherapy so after three months i saw my doctor and he said you wanna go back to work i said no i dont feel like it  right now im not ready  he said how much do you need i said well i dont know  he said would three months be ok i said i think three months would be fine  he said ok so take three months off  so he wrote me a note that i gave to my employer to make sure i got paid so i went to the south of france – wait a minute three months off with pay yes yes i get  paid by the government and then the other  is paid by my employer to make sure you get  so it was april it was spring again so i started right away sucking up some sun and that really helped me',\n",
       "  ' a lot to recharge my batteries i mean it was like night and day in three months i went from a  man to a  man again but thats because i had that time to take care of myself im not in a position to make any judgment concerning the american system i think the united states is a great great country americans are great people i really love them but as a doctor first as a citizen second and eventually as a patient third im very glad to be in france its kind of a luxury here you are sick you step in a hospital you get the care you need it doesnt depend on your premiums it depends on what you need one of the principles is solidarity people who are better off pay for those who are worse off you pay according to your means and you receive according to your needs do you think that will ever work in america no he could barely contain his seething antiamericanism and i just didnt want to listen to any more of it so i found a group of americans currently living in paris who i know would tell me the truth i was diagnosed five years ago with type i diabetes i was a bit nervous to tell them i had to tell the french theres a place to check off if you have a chronic condition i was nervous that they were going to charge me more and instead i went into a hospital and had roundtheclock care and they do an amazing amount of preventative care they asked if you have a preexisting condition not to punish you but to give you more help yes i was in the hospital for a year as soon as i was in it was well dont worry just rest  people said rest  how many sick days do you get a year i think its unlimited unlimited yes how can you limit sick days if youre sick youre sick ive gone to emergency rooms numerous times with four boys and have never waited more than an hour never i can call and somebody comes to the house in half an hour no way making a house call at your place how many of you have had a house call from a doctor no –  last friday and how much does this cost you nothing whats this service called where are we going we are going to see a man who has abdominal pain abdominal pain yeah where do we go next the next visit i say to anyone who asks me why im in this country is that i think its one of the friendliest countries that i know of and talk about family values – i mean childcare healthcare we dont pay for day care the day care where i send my daughter – and i was a teacher – standards are high so how much does it cost you to have two children here how much per hour are you happy with how theyre cared for here my kids are sure that they are going to get a certain level of care education – college i dont have to worry about – what do you mean its free youre kidding you can get a college education for free no way yes theres not a sense of desperation they rest they enjoy life they spend time with their kids theres vacations family time how many weeks of paid vacation minimum five weeks five weeks minimum of five weeks if you work for a large company you get sometimes eight ten weeks remember that there is a  week the productivity rate is so high here i read it was higher than the united states if theyre working more than  hours a week theyll get extra days off that is for parttime and fulltime employees you get five weeks paid vacation even if youre a parttime employee of course everybody if you get married you get an extra week or seven days for your honeymoon in addition to your five weeks youre paid to take your honeymoon also if you move you mean if you move from one apartment to another you get one day you get a day to move and they pay you these are the laws here when my daughter was three months old they sent somebody to you to give you tips on what to do with your child every single day for free and theyll come to your house and do your laundry they will sure no stop stop when you have a baby when you have a baby what are you doing you from the government can she do anything else if i want yes shes of course taking care of the children and i think if i ask her to prepare a meal for tonight she can do it no problem shes coming twice a week four hours a day so i can do everything i want for me for the house for my husband during four hours its very precious for me you dont have any associations nothing to help like that no nobody from the government comes to your home in america and does your laundry for you if youre a new mother its difficult yeah something that i experience a lot of with my own family is guilt guilt for being here almost and seeing the advantages and the benefits i have at such a young age things that my parents worked their whole life for and havent come close to touching its really hard to know that youre here in a very privileged position you know not living the highlife but in comparison definitely and that seems completely unfair one of the things that keeps everything running here is that the government is afraid of the people theyre afraid of protests theyre afraid of reactions from the people in the states people are afraid of the government theyre afraid of acting up theyre afraid of protesting afraid of getting out in france thats what people do free college education free medical care governmentissued nannies i began to wonder how do they pay for all this and then i realized theyre drowning in taxes i wanted to see what effect this would have on a nice french family so i went to find out – hello welcome – hello thank you its very nice – its the news – yes what is your combined income for the two of you together for say one month all right youre an engineer and shes an assistant not bad how much is your mortgage how many cars do you own two do you owe money from medical bills is there any other debt loans anything only the apartment what are your other expenses the fish fish vegetables vegetables are a big monthly expense for you yes and fruit yogurt yogurt what are your other big expenses very important kenya – we liked – are you happy – yes after seeing all this i began to wonder was there a reason our government and our media wants us to hate the french are they worried we might like the french or like their ways of doing things it was enough to make me put away my freedom fries meanwhile back at home hospitals had found a new way to deal with patients who didnt have health insurance and couldnt pay their bill i was standing against the wall and i saw a cab do a uturn and pull up to the curb i watched to see what was happening cause i had a feeling what would occur cause its not a new thing they pulled up right here by this yellow fire hydrant and dropped carol off and immediately pulled away and as soon as they pulled away she walked out into the street about up to here she then walked all the way down to the driveway down here completely confused has no shoes on whatsoever and just a hospital gown and those gowns are thin thats when one of our staff members went and asked carol if she needed assistance and found out that she was disoriented and didnt know where she was kaiser permanente in bellflower hospital had put her in a cab and directed them to bring her to this dropoff point but the names of the hospitals had been taken off both bracelets before she arrived i have seen others that have come through our doors who have ivs still in their arms they told me that at their shelter alone over  patients had been dumped there by hospitals the options are few we either open the front door and let them out which is not the humane thing to do or we try to find someplace for them to go and right now skid row is the best bed in town the night before we were there the county hospital run by the university of southern california one of the richest private schools in the country dumped another patient off on the curb a woman unable to pay her hospital bill – do you know how you got here i',\n",
       "  'n the cab in the cab from general hospital they gave him the voucher he dropped me off there he actually forced me out of the car maam are you in pain right now are you in pain yes is there anything we can do she at this time has broken ribs broken collarbone and stitches that are not completely healed across the top of her head and on the side of her head now let me ask you maam before they dropped you off did they ask you if you knew where you were going no they didnt ask you any questions about your orientation or whether or not you knew what was going on no they just told me to take care of myself may i take a minute to ask a question thats been on my mind who are we is this what weve become a nation that dumps its own citizens like so much garbage on the side of the curb because they cant pay their hospital bill i always thought and believe to this day that were a good and generous people this is what we do if somebodys in trouble anybody gets sick we all get together and help people with a good heart you feel like youre sacrificing but you get a blessing from doing this and a good soul weve got a lot of support and were gonna all keep working until we locate this child neighbors quick to lend a helping hand to anyone in their hour of need i deliver meals to them but my life has been so blessed that this is just the least that i can do they say that you can judge a society by how it treats those who are the worst off but is the opposite true that you can judge a society by how it treats its best its heroes the firefighters and police rescue and recovery workers have responded with true heroism it was their initial heroism that thwarted the objectives of the terrorists without regard in many instances to their own safety and security they truly are heroes – we owe them everything here they are the men and women who have been on the front lines for new york and for all of us in america tonight is dedicated to you dont forget about the raffles going on over there – one dollar each i spent two and a half years down there i got upper and lower breathing problems i need a double lung transplant but was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis i havent slept in a bed in over five years i sleep on a chair with a blanket because if i lay down i cant breathe there were hundreds of rescue workers on  who were not city employees but rather ran down to ground zero on their own to help out we need volunteers for first aid and many developed serious respiratory illnesses thats when the government said theyre not our responsibility because they werent on our payroll  john graham is an emt volunteer from paramus new jersey he was in lower manhattan when he heard the planes hit and rushed over to help he worked in the rescue effort for the next few months but then had trouble receiving benefits for his illness they just deny you for any reason its just a terrible waiting game i really feel like theyre waiting for you to die its terrible i never thought that we would do this that the united states would do this william maher is a volunteer member of new jerseys fire service he spent to months working near the pile at ground zero recovering bodies or body parts and it deeply affected him im experiencing a lot of disturbing dreams or whatever youd like to call them and it affected what i was doing at night and unaware of it because i was asleep and i just kept grinding and grinding my teeth the upper fronts are damaged practically beyond repair because of my constant grinding over the last three years ive been before a workers comp board already for the  volunteers fund ive been denied three times and hopefully i will go on my fourth appeal soon if i can get the necessary documentation of course there was a  million fund set up supposedly to help rescue workers ladies and gentlemen the governor of new york george pataki but the government like the health insurance companies made it very difficult for people to receive help you have to have spent a certain amount of time at ground zero you have to be able to establish that you do have to file an affidavit within the next year relating your work experiences at ground zero and then even with all of that its not automatic there is a presumption when certain illnesses occur but that presumption can be rebutted by other medical evidence we think it is a very fair approach that protects our heroes im sorry reggie cervantes was a volunteer medical technician on  nothing makes it go away sometimes not water not cough medicine anything its just burning in my throat and irritated and it just gets me to coughing sometimes i have trouble breathing cause i cant catch my breath reggie spent her days at ground zero carrying bodies and treating other rescue workers my airway was totally burnt that first week and i had trouble breathing by then but we wanted to see if we could dig anybody up alive we wanted to see if we had lost anybody if we were still missing somebody i wanted to help i was trained for this you know you see somebody who is in need you help em reggie had difficulty getting treatment too sick to work and with no income she was forced to quit her job and used her savings to move her and her kids out of the city its hard to figure out how youre supposed to get help were trying to go about it the right way but were ignored but not everyone after  was ignored by the government were now approaching the fiveyear anniversary of the  attacks so im announcing today that khalid sheikh mohammed abu zubaydah ramzi binalshibh and  other terrorists in cia custody have been transferred to the us naval base at guantanamo bay on that island are some of the worlds most hardened enemy combatants these detainees are deadly and include the  hijacker as well as a number of osama bin ladens personal bodyguards and others who had a direct role in the september  attacks the kind of people held at guantanamo include terrorist trainers bombmakers many of them have american blood on their hands and are the elite of alqaida it seems to me we have an obligation to treat these individuals as enemy combatants and then i learned it wasnt all bad news at gitmo detainees representing a threat to our national security are given access to topnotch medical facilities they have acute care  hours a day in which surgical procedures everything can be performed right there in the detainee camps this is the dental clinic or the health clinic we have a physical therapy department x ray capabilities with digital xrays we have one single operating room health personnel to detainee ratio is one to four remarkably high they do sick call on the blocks three times per week care for them there if they can or bring that detainee back to the clinic to be seen there screening for cancer has taken place colonoscopy is a procedure which is performed there on a routine basis we have diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterol we monitor the weight and nutrition of the detainees so that we can track those detainees to make sure we see them frequently monitoring their labs and their overall health their medical attention they get way better medical treatment than ive ever had you think its as good as most us hmos – certainly very similar and as good sir i leave with an impression that healthcare there is clearly better than they received at home and as good as many people receive in the united states of america wow so there is actually one place on american soil that had free universal healthcare thats all i needed to know i went down to miami florida got myself a boat and loaded up bill and reggie and john john welcome sir and anyone else i could find who needed to see a doctor and couldnt afford one so many people showed up i had to get a couple extra boats and i called up donna smith from denver who is now on nine differe',\n",
       "  'nt medications and asked her if shed like to come along i figured shed like to get out of her daughters basement for a while all right lets go which way to guantanamo bay can we go were not going to cuba were going to america its american soil we made it there it is theres the runway thats the prison over there where the detainees are were very close yeah were very close the white building is the hospital i think ok lets go we commandeered a fishing boat and sailed into guantanamo bay as we approached the line in the water beteen the american and cuban side we were told to be careful for mines permission to enter i have three  rescue workers they need some medical attention these are  rescue workers they just want some medical attention the same kind that alqaida is getting they dont want any more than youre giving the evildoers just the same hello no one in the guard tower was responding and then we heard a siren we figured it was time to get out of here but what was i supposed to do with these sick people and no one to help them i mean here we were stuck in some godforsaken third world country and communists no less when i was a kid these people wanted to kill us what was i supposed to do excuse me were looking for a doctor is there a doctor here in cuba any doctors all in this one block all right thank you very much thank you ok ok i know what youre thinking cuba is where lucifer lives the worse place on earth the most evil nation ever created how do we know that cause thats what weve been told for over  years a series of offensive missile sites can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the western hemisphere im not gonna yield until fidel castro allows freedom on the island thats a you can count on it put it in the bank it seems that what really bugged us about castro was that he overthrew the dictator that we liked and replaced him with a guy we didnt like – himself and so now after all these years one thing is clear – the cuban people have free universal healthcare theyve become known as having not only one of the best healthcare systems but as being one of the most generous countries in providing doctors and medical equipment to third world countries in the us healthcare costs run nearly   per person but in cuba they spend only   and yet the cubans are able to have a lower infant mortality rate than the us a longer average life span than the united states they believe in preventive medicine and it seems like theres a doctor on every block their only sin when it comes to healthcare seems to be that they dont do it for a profit anybody need medication right now from the pharmacy are you the pharmacist yes do you have this is this one similar to yours yeah its  in the us this is  in the us yes how much is that in american dollars its like five cents five cents yeah more or less thank you very much muchas gracias  is a lot of money when you get  in social security disability and need one or two a month five cents here its like the biggest insult it just doesnt make any sense it doesnt make any sense i wanna fill a suitcase up and go back home with it i took my group of sick americans to a hospital to see if they could get some care they didnt ask for money or an insurance card just their name and date of birth that was the entire intake session thank you very much for doing this i asked them to give us the same exact care they give their fellow cuban citizens no more no less and thats what they did im dr roque im an internal medicine specialist john graham how are you feeling my lungs hurt i have pain i get pretty severe nosebleeds at times i get terrible headaches in the night but i havent been evaluated for the sleep apnea for nine years yeah i have many medications for lung problems almost every medication for lung problems ive got after  things have happened my teeth started falling out because of certain conditions i was grinding theres one test that they recommended i take its about  to   the dentist that i talked to its like  or more its two years i have no medical coverage so i cant go for the last part of the test its ok everythings gonna be ok right yes i am so its so hard for me to digest somebody saying its free because  years of our lives have been spent fighting so i am so grateful no you dont need to say that thank you thank you ok come on dont cry everythings gonna be ok right thank you at least what we can do right reggie was diagnosed with pulmonary and bronchial problems the cuban doctors gave her a treatment plan to follow back home along with some of those five cent inhalers william maher received a number of treatments on his neck and his back having ground down his teeth for three years due to posttraumatic stress he left cuba with a new set of teeth after a series of tests on his heart lungs blood and stomach john now knew what his ailments were he was given a strict plan to follow plus a number of treatments and was feeling better than he had in years the cuban doctors were able to take donna off five of her nine medications and with a correct diagnosis gave her a treatment plan to help her live a more normal life when firefighters and paramedics in havana heard that the  rescue workers were in town they invited them over to one of their firehouses and so on our last day there as we arrived they stood at attention because they said they wanted to honor the heroes of  sí somos familia y los hermanos que perdimos en las torres gemelas se sintió en el mundo completo the brothers we lost on  was felt around the world mis hermanos mis hermanos dont hesitate to hug a brother its very important for them to wear the scba so they dont end up like me – theyre lungs – these tanks scba selfcontained breathing apparatus tenemos una reserva también en el carro es un placer poder venir aquí esto es lo único que tenemos nosotros f ff three fs if this is what can happen between supposed enemies if one enemy can hold out his hand and offer to heal then what else is possible thats when i heard that the man who runs the biggest antimichael moore website on the internet was going to have to shut it down he could no longer afford to keep it up because his wife was ill and they couldnt afford to pay for her health insurance he was faced with a choice of either keep attacking me or pay for his wifes health fortunately he chose his wife but something seemed wrong about being forced into such a decision why in a free country shouldnt he be able to have health insurance and exercise his first amendment right to run me into the ground so i wrote a check for the   he needed to keep his wife insured and in treatment and sent it to him anonymously his wife got better and his website is still going strong  michael moore it was hard for me to acknowledge that in the end we truly are all in the same boat and that now matter what are differences we sink or swim together thats how it seems to be everywhere else they take care of each other no matter what their disagreements you know when we see a good idea from another country we grab it if they build a better car we drive it if they make a better wine we drink it so if theyve come up with a better way to treat the sick to teach their kids to take care of their babies to simply be good to each other then whats our problem why cant we do that they live in a world of we not me well never fix anything until we get that one basic thing right and powerful forces hope that we never do and that we remain the only country in the western world without free universal health care you know if we ever did remove the chokehold of medical bills college loans daycare and everything else that makes us afraid to step out of line well watch out cause it will be a new day in america in the meantime im gonna go get the government to do my laundr'],\n",

like–  my cardiologist went thats not good my latin friend said no you could dance to that thats kinda cool and then they did the angiogram and i heard my–  i had a blown valve which makes me sound like a chevrolet like what the fuck and they started offering me choices about what type of valves i could get and here were some of my choices number one– a porcine valve which is a pig valve which is kind of cool because youre already inoculated for swine flue number one and one of the side effects is you can find truffles which is kind of cool i was hoping to get an equine valve cause then you can hang out of your shorts like oh my god baby im sorry i just got excited you know to get out of the house you have to have a midget jump on your back going were going outside right now how many months since the surgery five and they offered me a mechanical valve which is kind of cool i thought maybe i can get the new apple iheart that would be great it comes with  emotions and that would be– and i thought wait a minute if i could get an iheart ladies how about this instead of breast implants– speakers wouldnt that be cool well call em blue tits theyll be compatible with the heart and if you cant afford speakers just put in a squeak toy were that simple thatd be great a lot of you men would be going–  oh yeah baby   and ill put a whistle in my dick so when you blow me– whoo kind of fun but i ended up getting a bovine valve which is a cow valve which is kind of cool cause you can shit standing up thats great great to be here nice to be here but after the surgery you get very emotional its like– its like weird people go how are you  god thanks for asking and i got so emotional i thought instead of a valve they gave me a tiny vagina which is lik',\n",

things like i know about russia because i can see it from my backyard you have super vision number one i can see san quentin from my backyard but that doesnt qualify me on prison reform what the fuck and its incredible too she said polar bears are not endangered theyre just unlucky oh really and who knew katie couric was the cutting edge of journalism with ambush questions like what do you read

walters in the last few days of the election she got really sexy she let the hair down i thought the last day of the election she was gonna pop the prada and be like yeah how do you like my northern slopes now boys drill baby drill baby drill and do you think the whole time she was running for office clinton was sitting at home going where was she when i was in office shit god damn she is hot whoa thats a milf thats a mother id like to filibuster yeah and bill did some good work recently he went to north korea got the two girls home way to go bill way to go got them back way to go good job

kennedy maria shriver who has been getting thinner and fucking thinner and smaller i believe he is sucking the kennedy out of her shh slowly but surely becoming a kennedy by assimilation which is kind of cool thats how you get a liberal republican which is neat its like a volvo with a gun rack you dont see a lot of them and in terms of energy policies',\n",

off the petroleum titty its like were trying to kick it and how are we doing this were looking for alternative fuels some of the alternative fuels are a hydrogen powered car cool idea if youre thinking of a hydrogen powered car i have one word for you– hindenburg good luck a more interesting gas and a lot more fun is helium number one with helium you could float over the potholes and if you

reasons one to kick start my brain number two and more importantly to jumpstart my colon more importantly the moment i have my morning coffee its like morning everybody fire in the hole son open the bathroom door i dont care if youre rubbing one out ive got to drop a resume open the door and even the dog is going hes leaking methane theres a dead canary in the corner like and i went wait a minute

handsfree means hands free to talk on the phone this does not mean find another activity for your hands like text messaging no no texting and driving at the same time is like jerking off and juggling at the same time too many balls in the air if you catch my driftand unless youre gonna develop an eye like a chameleon where one looks down and one looks ahead your brain will eventually go i cant do

ducks hanging upside down in the market thatll be cool and therell be the village peoples republic going ♪ young mao theres a place you can go ♪ ♪ i say young mao ♪ and before the olympics the tibetans were demonstrating against the chinese it was kind of sad too because the chinese accused the tibetans of being terrorists which is weird a tibetan terrorist is like an amish hacker– it just doesnt fit and then california went we are gonna boycott chinese products in sympathy with the tibetans then they went fuck they make everything and they even make the free tibet stickers so its fucking insane and the weird thing in the chinese olympics beijing– one of the most polluted cities in the world during the olympics no pollution how did they pull this off i believe they sent one billion chinese into beijing everyone breathe in  one of my favorite events during the olympics was womens gymnastics which is kind of a misnomer these are not women these are shetland females and some of the events are a little  like the uneven parallel bars is a bit like horizontal pole dancing its like daddy would like to watch this alone if you dont mind and who invented that event was there some german at a playground going heres my idea for girls in tight clothing– i want you to put on spandex and then spin around on the upper bar and slam your vagina into the lower bar spin around whos your daddy whos your daddy whos your daddy spread your legs and then dismount and make it look like you had a good time what weird and they do all this incredible stuff and if their foot goes one inch to the right youre fucked and who invented the pommel horse was it a cowboy with add going im on the horse im off the horse im on the horse im off the horse no my favorite athletes of any olympics are always the african distance runners you never have to drugtest an african distance runner are you on drugs no im looking for food and im sure in kenya theres a chicken that runs a subtwohour marathon you just won the new york marathon how do you feel  what did he say hes wondering where the ethiopians are one of my favorite runners of all time was abebe bikila he was an ethiopian distance runner and he won the rome olympics running barefoot he was then sponsored by adidas he ran the next olympics he carried the fucking shoes no performance enhancement there no way because always people are looking for performance enhancement cut to the american swim team with their new porpoise foreskin swimsuits– fullbody condom swimsuits what the fuck was going on these guys were',\n",
       "  ' shaved like a brazilian hooker to begin with what was going on was there one pubic hair like  and they put on that fullbody condom– even the penis is like im in here help me but i realized the moment you do that– no nutsack drag youre a ken doll all of a sudden are you ready to swim  i think so but no more– no more nutsack drag  nutsack drag with this then you get to the end of the pool  faster why no nutsack drag and the french got pissed off going they have no nutsack drag theyre cheating and michael phelps is on the box of frosted flakes then he gets caught smoking weed and then take him off the box of frosted flakes –  – this is a failure in marketing my friends listen if youre basically having frosted flakes and youre older than  years old and its after  in the morning –  – im gonna guess weed may be involved and you cant tell me marijuana is a performanceenhancing drug fuck off its only a performanceenhancing drug if theres a fucking chocolate bar at the end of the pool then even a onelegged swimmer will go i will beat your ass but performance enhancement doesnt always include drugs cut to miss semenya the south african middledistance runner who turns out to be a heshe shes a hermaphrodite she can have her own biathlon– kind of neat but this is not new the east germans used to have really butch female sprinters olga you just won the  meters how do you feel  really good is that a penis no just a very large clitoris oh and the germans used to give their athletes pure fucking speed they would finish a race going hans you just won a race how do you feel wonderful but the spiders are crawling all over me again and the one drug they seem to have the most problem with is steroids and there are always these poor fuckers who get caught doing steroids and they deny it and yet they look like a mardi gras float bubba are you doing steroids no wheres your neck i havent seen it for a while what about your balls i dont know youre taking horse genome no no and its weird too why would people take steroids in football when in football the object of the game is to be a big fucking mountain of flesh breaking past another mountain of flesh and grabbing the little guy and going tell me about the rabbits thats the game but maybe if you get caught doing steroids instead of kicking you off the team you have to take another drug like ecstasy to compensate its gonna make the huddles a lot more fun youre gonna come into the huddle like hi sorry about the long count i just felt such love and the other drug that people are doing is human growth hormone i first heard about human growth hormone from nick nolte who was telling me the advances of human growth hormone he was like robin human growth hormone is amazing its taking – argh he went fucking stiff as a board and i went ill get back to you nick good luck insane but there was one guy– one guy who had an amazing claim to fame in terms of drugs and sport his name was dock ellis and dock ellis did an incredible thing the one person who knows– thank you dock ellis pitched a nohitter on lsd those who have taken lsd tell the others how hard that might be fuck off if i took lsd id be talking to every blade of grass like sorry sorry to walk into a majorleague baseball stadium like the whole field is like fuck fuck fucfuck all the fans in the stadium like the umpire walks out its shiva  the catcher steps out instead of a mask hes wearing a samurai mask  instead of a glove its a vagina come to daddy the batter walks out instead of cleats hes got hooves yes instead of a bat its a cobra  you walk out on the mound even your gloves going this is fucking weird the ball– yes i love you lets do this do it daddy do it   past the cobra into the vagina  for nine fucking innings fuck me its like wow he should have his own blacklight room at the hall of fame when i was growing up they used to say robin drugs can kill you and now that im  my doctors going robin you need drugs to live and i realized my doctors my dealer now and a lot harder to get ahold of and hes always giving me free samples like yo robin some lipitor motherfucker try it out thats all i can hook you up with right now i got an hmo on my back baby thats all i can do and its weird too– these drugs have side effects that go on for fucking days like tendency to grow another head oh my god when we were growing up we knew the side effects of the drugs we were taking cocaine– side effects were paranoia and ninjas on the lawn i remember that quaaludes– side effects were talking in tongues english as a second language i remember that marijuana– side effects side were laughter and frosted flakes thats all i remember but now there are side effects which fucking rival the syndrome theres a syndrome called restless leg syndrome what the fuck is that a tendency to break out into a riverdance like oh dear christ grandmas got fucking restless leg syndrome take care of kids im on my way to dublin take care and side effects include compulsive gambling and obsessive sexual behavior thats not a side effect thats fucking vegas they should just give you a bus ticket and say good luck and how soon before they have a drug where side effects may include rectal ventriloquism if your asshole starts talking call the doctor or get friends over cause its gonna be a fun night and what a great side effect for a politician i was never with that woman liar liar hes an asshole and so am i and the one drug they give you thats kind of wonderful before the surgery was viagra– a great drug amazing a lot of fun after openheart surgery– not so much fun taking viagra after openheart surgery is like a civil war reenactment with live ammo– not good its a duel to the death between your dick and your heart the moment you take it

one drop of sperm with two  sperms going where the fuck are we i never thought id be called into action this is crazy im sure if you had a microscope they both would have walkers like keep moving my tail is cramping god damn it head towards the tits i know my way from there and im sure theres two othesperms in my balls going wait here if she puts a finger in the ass then we go yes indeed but theres another drug– another drug they dont tell you is a drug its a  narcotic– alcohol and the only warning they have on the bottle of alcohol is dont drink this if youre pregnant bullshit thats how you got pregnant and alcohol is especially dangerous for people like myself– alcoholics or you can say ethanolchallenged whatever you want to call ',\n",
       "  'it and people go now robin how do i know if im an alcoholic well as one let me give you some warning signs number one– after a night of heavy drinking you wake up fullyclothed going hey somebody shit in my pants number two– you have a couple of cocktails and you find yourself on the freeway going what are these fuckers doing going the wrong way– number two number three– you get drunk you go out for indian food you wake up in bombay with a camel licking your balls tadah you are an alcoholic and some people say robin im a functioning alcoholic you can be one its like being a paraplegic lap dancer you can do it just not as well as the others really and they say alcoholism is peer pressure bullshit peer pressure for an alcoholic is psst come here and i believe alcoholics are gods rodeo clowns were the ones doing the stupid shit nobody else will do were the ones coming out of chute number five on a fifth of vodka like yeehaw looking for a woman whos going youre the one yeah and were moody little motherfuckers too cause well be like goddamn it man i love you ill fucking kill you step outside ill kick my ass goddamn it lets do this poor me goddamn poor me poor me another drink and we think were sexy too cause well come up to women going like hey baby were your parents retarded because you sure are special and we see nothing wrong with that weve got backup if that doesnt work we go hey sit on my face ill guess your weight yeah  and ladies if you take an alcoholic home for the night oh good luck youre in for a fun evening its like playing pool with a rope good fucking luck hell be like i love you  i love you and the next morning that allimportant question who the fuck are you  oh my god well at least ill get a sweater cool fuckina cause you see as an alcoholic you will violate your standards quicker than you can lower them you will do shit that even the devil would go dude and theres a voice that tells alcoholics we can drink its the same voice you hear if you can go up to the top of a very large building and you look over the side theres a little voice that goes jump you can fly even though your asshole is going no you cant and if you ever thought about jumping off a tall building there was a guy who jumped off the golden gate bridge and he survived and he said this– he said halfway down i thought it was a bad idea and some things you may want to stay away from while drinking heavily ebay– not a good idea ebay and alcoholism– a perfect storm addiction youll find yourself up to your ass in george foreman grills and shamwows another thing you dont want to do while really drunk is get a tattoo i did i got really loaded i got a tattoo in mandarin that says happiness and laughter right here i think it says that ive never had a chinese person that close to my balls going thats what it says but i had a friend get really fucked up and he got a tattoo in mandarin thats supposed to say golden warrior and a chinese friend said no it says ass monkey then the idiot went out and got drunk again and got a tattoo in hindu that was supposed to say dawn of enlightenment and a hindu friend said no it says deliveries on tuesday so he is not the ass monkey who delivers on tuesday for the rest of his life and girls if you want to get that lovely tattoo of the sunrise rising out of your ass crack– gorgeous when youre  but when youre  its an octopus chasing a fucking starfish so no be careful and if they made a drug that allowed you to drink and not get drunk an alcoholic would go what happens if you take two no cause we have these things called blackouts as alcoholics its not really blackouts its more like sleepwalking with activities kind of strange i believe its your conscience going into a witness protection program its your conscience going youre about to fuck a hobbit i gotta go good luck im gonna leave the dick on and after an hour im opening up the asshole but that didnt stop you tuesday good luck take care and alcoholics were like assholes we cant wait to shit on everybody– family friends well be like fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you go fuck yourself fuck you fuck im fucked and they tried to send my ass to rehab and i went yeah yeah yeah and i went to rehab in wine country just to keep my options open and while i was in rehab i read an article in the inquirer about my being drunk it was like that poor fuck oh fuck thats me and the weird thing too about when you read articles in the inquirer or tmz and youre looking at all these assholes going those poor motherfuckers and only the germans could come up with the word for that– feeling pleasure at other peoples misfortune its called schadenfreude and only the germans could go we found the fucking word for that god bless you i was once on a german talk show and if you want to go on one its a lot of fun its really fun and i was on this german talk show and this woman said to me she said mr williams why do you think theres not so much comedy in germany and i said did you and ever think you killed all the funny people  and it was– and heres what got interesting she didnt bat an eyelash she just went no at that point even gods going do you get it german comedy knock knock we ask the questions its like the french production of anne frank– shes upstairs and we have a german pope now how do you get a german pope well its a tough gig they dont retire the jersey like magic johnson you stay in the chair to the bitter end remember john paul ii it was like  in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti were lucky he didnt have dementia in the yankee stadium going everybody gets pudding chocolate pudding chocolate pudding and when the pope dies the vatican finds out youre dead the oldfashioned way they have a guy come with a silver hammer– not maxwell– but he comes and he basically comes in– he basically comes in and goes pwap and if the pope goes ahh one more week hes got another week and the moment the pope dies they take him through saint peters basilica and  cell phones are like  and im sure that was his last wish when i die i want to be a screen saver and then what happens the college of cardinals they all go into a small dark room and the only thing that comes out is smoke and im going what are you doing in there and i believe they have da vincis hookah and theyre inside getting a little loaded going  i got a crazy idea no no no wait wait wait wait listen this is crazy no wait the last pope was polish right yeah no wait– this is a good one hold on how about this no wait this is crazy how about this a nazi  no no hitler youth its like boy scouts with artillery its great itll scare the shit out of the jews theyll be like oy and i was hoping rather than a german pope they would do something cool like a latin american pope man that would have been cool like pope enrique yeah that would be cool and hed have the cool popemobile like ave maria check it out–  or a brazilian pope cause then you could have the samba nuns in the thongs going come on back to the church come on back to the church you know you want to come back to the church come on back to the church i',\n",
       "  'm sure the kids would go fuck the internet im going back to church but its weird the vatican and homosexuality– oil water the pope is always homosexuality is an abomination time out youre the pope yes youre dressed like freddy mercurys stunt double your purse is on fire and youre surrounded by hundreds of boys and youve had kind of a problem in the afterschool area and why is there a problem with pedophilia in the catholic church well its a big deal you become a priest– retire this and once a week were gonna put you in a small dark box and people are gonna tell you their nastiest sexual shit bless me father for i have sinned yes my son last night i had sex with two thai twins a slip n slide a diving helmet and a ferret could you say that slower my son and i believe the vaticans gonna come out one day and come out big its gonna be ♪ in nomine patris ♪  ♪ et spiritus santi ♪ ♪ one secular sensation ♪ ♪ all the folks you meet ♪ ♪ da da da da da da ♪ ♪ one singular salvation ♪ ♪ every word on the street ♪ ♪ da da da da da da ♪ and there still will be the evangelicals going homosexuality is a sickness and the same reverend will be caught buying crack from a gay prostitute going we were just playing tummy swords and then hell deny it going i did not perform a homosexual act no you didnt elton john is a homosexual act you just blew that guy its okay and this reverend went to rehab for homosexuality im going i was in rehab i didnt see that wing there was no cockenders in my rehab and is homosexuality a preexisting condition what the fuck and the other people that come out against the whole thing are the mormons they came out against gay marriage big time and with gay marriage you couldnt even say gay marriage in california you couldnt call it gay marriage it was like what do we call it well call it samesex marriage and people who have been married for a long time are going thats a little redundant if youve been married a long time its always the same sex shut the fuck– what and then they said well call it a union then the union guys get pissed going its not a fucking union its not local cocksuckers  and youre going wait a minute canada has gay marriage do you want all the gay people to immigrate to canada then theyll win figure skating for the next  years no theyre already the nicest people on the planet do you want them to be the best dressed thats bullshit and the whole thing– and we talked briefly about this before– the other people that come out against gay marriage were the mormons basically the mormons– the people that used to do polygamy– they used to perfect polygamy a mormon giving marital advice is like the octomom running a planned parenthood clinic and if the answer to whos your daddy is multiple choice come with me my friend and who thought polygamy was a great idea who got married and went my one marriage isnt going so well id like to double down fuck off man and if you– why would you want another strong opinion even if you marry a deaf and a blind girl they will fucking communicate and they will work out that you are the asshole in marriage ive learned this in marriage theres penalties for early withdrawal and deposit in another account remember that and alimony doesnt stop people alimony– look at a guy you could call it all the money and guys would still be going im in lets do this look at donald trump hes always going this ones broken bring me another one ha ha ha but maybe there should be a threestrike law with marriage if you want to get married for a fourth time you have to give up a body part then that might slow people down like bob how many times you been married four times robin ted how many times you been married  five times robin five times larry king would just be a fucking head on a stick and you talk about intelligent design– look at the human body its wasteprocessing plant near a recreation area how intelligent is that and they say the platypus was an animal designed by committee was the human body designed by committee was there a group of guys who designed it was the guy going tom do you have those designs for the human reproductive system i do ted lets show you what we came up with normally with the mammal penis we have the retractable we decided to something different for the mammal– the male penis for the human we call it the collapsible kind of fun and look at this murray came up with the idea of making the covering optional thank you murray way to go when we take the covering off its a little sharp a little pointy we need something on the top to soften it up bob what was your idea a mushroom cap thank you bob we put the mushroom cap on the top and its kind of a tool cause when its retracted it looks like a little toad stool and when its erect like a little soldier– thank you and tim put a piece of sting up at the top thank you tim i guess to tune it thank you tim and we run the semen out the top and urine through– we also run urine through there we call it multitasking or coming and going kind of a fun concept and initially we just had the sperm stored inside the penis itself like a toothpaste tube– pbbt gone so we need something to store it in and produce it what was your idea carl nuts thank you carl initially we used walnuts weve had good luck with those in the past and the human males are going we cant sneak up on the females what do you mean listen  got it forget the coconuts lets try something different bob what was your idea to replace them balls balls thats it who doesnt like balls what fun initially we used three balls and heres some of the tests with the three balls they were going everywhere the male was like playing with the balls playing with the balls and we went wed better put those in a bag so we decided to make a bag and the only thing we had lying around was some old turkey neck i said use it lets try it so we put the balls in the turkey neck and um its ugly i think yeah next to the asshole its one of the uglier things we made really and we got some negative feedback from the females who were going were not going down there unless you cover that up okay so we put some garnish around it and initially we made the hair straight the females my eyes okay curly we put curly hair and initially we put the hair everywhere– even the top of the penis and it looked like my uncle phil like hey how are you so we just went with a topiary thing which was kind of fun and then the females went well go down there now thank you ladies thank you which is cool because you can start the penis orally– thank you manually– thank you manuel for finding that out finger in the ass– ted found that out he said it was an accident kidder and if you play with the balls the penis likes that its kind of fun but we did find out a negative thing about the balls if you hit them really hard its a total system reset its like if it was a slot machine it would pay it was kind of rough but thats essentially the design for the penis initially we gave the male about  sperms and those were gone in a millisecond and now we give him  to  billion and he shoots them everywhere t',\n",
       "  'its drapes we found some on the ceiling those are the overachievers we hope some make it to the vagina in terms of the vagina carls in charge of the vagina project carl what did you come up with well normally with the mammal vagina you have the genital slit or opening we decided to accessorize it what did you accessorize it with carl curtains we just thought it makes it less of an opening and more of a show really kind of– we had some old lips lying around we said try those lets give it a go and initially we made it horizontal and the damn thing talked it was weird and the first time it talked the males were going im not going down there if it talks ive already got one opinion down here i dont need a second one fine so now we made it vertical and now it just farts so– and the first time it went it was like  easy big fella and the asshole got offended saying thats my job okay hold on yours will smell not to worry not to worry but we needed something kind of special– one last little thing that would really work and clint came up with a brilliant idea and i think were gonna name it– its kind of wonderful clint what was your idea a doorbell thank you clint you ring the doorbell the curtains open its kind of fun some guys cant find it others dont know when to stop ringing it but you ring the doorbell the curtains open the penis goes inside and tom worked out some choreography for the balls thats kind of fun thats really it gets everything ready to go and the sperms fly out up into the human female she carries the egg normally we gave it– we tried first giving the egg to the male he kept losing it and we went fine we gave it to the female she carries it and then we thought the male will be in charge of feeding the infant we gave the human male two breasts and the male is like ha okay nipples thats all we thought the female will be in charge of feeding the infant too so we gave her six breasts like a mammal and the male was like ha ha ah ha ha two hands two tits thats it and so the female will carry the infant to term and it will come out through the curtains and they get wide like broadway and shell also feed the infant the male will assist ha ha but we do have one major design flaw weve tried to wire the penis to the conscience and it keeps short circuiting and its weird too– the whole thing i mean every since i was a little boy it was like the first time i was cleaning it it went off im sorry and then later on it was like breasts breasts breasts aha ha ha vagina vagina vagina and by the time you get to be  it gets a little more difficult okay heres what you gotta do you put a sparkler in your ass ill set my pubic hair on fire you put on a german army helmet you jump off the couch yelling fire in the hole that might work i dont know and then if that doesnt work theres always pornography and the definition of pornography is quite simple erotic is using a feather pornography is using the entire chicken which is weird and ive been watching a little bit of porn since ive been on the road a little shut up thats fine and with porn movies they dont have coming attractions cause if it was youd be like oh done thank you fine with porn movies when youre watching them its basically theyre an hour and a half long and who watches an entire fucking porn movie one guy up there going i do but an entire porn– an hour and a half long even with fast forwarding– fast forwarding youre like ahhhhh ahh ahhhhh ahhhhh what no and the one thing you dont want with porn is basically slow motion cause its like haaa prrrggh ahhh  and the acting– the acting in porn movies is always so bad theres always that one girl whos like  its not miss america stay with the dick what are you doing and why do they always have to have such bad actors theyre always like im going to fuck you so hard even my right hand is going i dont believe him but theres scripts theres scripts for porn movies somebodys writing this stuff going im going to fuck you

said every time i clap my hands a child in africa dies and from the back of the scottish audience somebody went then stop fucking clapping your hands its weird though i want to do something kind of special right now and dedicate it to a friend of mine it was a man i knew– a very interesting guy– walter cronkite incredible man and we worked together on a disney project years ago  and he was a very eloquent and elegant man but walter had another side basically he liked his jokes like he liked his ocean a little blue so i would like to do a joke right now for walter as walter in his memory  a man and his wife are having sex theyre going at it hot and heavy suddenly they hear a noise its their little son timmy standing in the doorway timmy is shocked and runs out of the room the father goes ill go talk to timmy he goes to timmys room he opens the door and little timmy is giving it hot and heavy to grandma the father goes oh my god and little timmy says not so funny when its your
